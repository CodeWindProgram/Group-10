## Work Report

	-> Plan the flow of how to come up with the solution. [1], [2], [7]

	-> Researched on PostgreSQL [1], [5], [11]

	-> Researched on high availability, data redundancy, data duplications, localhost/public host server. [2], [3], [4], [6]

	-> Researched on creating database on PostgreSQL [5], [6], [7]

	-> Created Database and imported data in it. [1], [5], [6]
