-> Plan the flow of how to come up with the solution.
-> Researched on PostgreSQL
-> Researched on high availability, data redundancy, data duplications, localhost/public host server.
-> Researched on creating database on PostgreSQL
-> Created Database and imported data in it.
-> Performed database duplication for backing up data in case of database corruption.
-> Attempted server duplication to guarantee high availability of servers in case of failover.
-> Researched on how  to configure synchronous streaming replication to attain real-time updation of backup server.
-> Created testcases to verify stable working of server and databases.
-> Attempted hosting a server for a private network by allowing listening configuration.
-> Generated final report on the successfully implemented and attempted tasks as well as further implementations that can be done.
